# Nigeria-Real-Estate-Project

My Data Science Project.  

Nigeria-Real-Estate-Project (Data Sourcing ).

In  a bit to replicate what I have done while 
working on the first two projects in the Applied 
Data Science Course at WorldQuant University— 
where I applied the data wrangling and visualization 
skills that I learnt, in examining the real estate market 
in Mexico(First Project), and also created a machine learning 
model that predicts apartment prices in Buenos Aires, 
Argentina(Second Project).  

I went on Kaggle  to source for a dataset to this effect. 
In my search, I stumbled on the CSV file— "nigeria_houses_data.csv" 
uploaded by Abdullahi Yunus.  https://lnkd.in/djmDdXVX  

This dataset contains House listings in Nigeria and their prices based 
on Location and other parameters.  

Datashape (24326, 8)==> 24,326 houses (rows) and 8 Parameters (columns) . 
 
**PARAMETERS:**

✓Bedrooms -> number of bedrooms in the houses ‌‌

✓ Bathrooms -> number of bathrooms in the houses ‌‌

✓ Toilets -> number of toilets  ‌‌

✓ Parking_space ‌‌

✓ Title -> house type ‌‌

✓ Town -> town in which the house is located ‌‌

✓ State -> state within Nigeria in which the house is located, and finally
 ‌
✓ Price -> the target column.  

Now that our Dataset is ready, be on the look out for  my next post on how 
I progressed in the project to creating a machine learning model that 
predicts the price of Detached Duplex in Lagos State, Nigeria .
