# Nigeria-Real-Estate-Project

In  a bit to replicate what I have done while 
working on the first two projects in the Applied 
Data Science Course at WorldQuant University— 
where I applied the data wrangling and visualization 
skills that I learnt, in examining the real estate market 
in Mexico(First Project), and also created a machine learning 
model that predicts apartment prices in Buenos Aires, 
Argentina(Second Project). 

__Operations performed are:__

__Data Sourcing:__
I went on Kaggle  to source for a dataset to this effect. 
In my search, I stumbled on the CSV file— "nigeria_houses_data.csv" 
uploaded by Abdullahi Yunus.  https://lnkd.in/djmDdXVX  

This dataset contains House listings in Nigeria and their prices based 
on Location and other parameters.  

Datashape (24326, 8)==> 24,326 houses (rows) and 8 parameters (columns) .
