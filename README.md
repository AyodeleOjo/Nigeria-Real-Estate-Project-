# Nigeria-Real-Estate-Project-
My Data Science Project.  Nigeria-Real-Estate-Project (Data Sourcing ).  In  a bit to replicate what I have done while working on the first two projects in the Applied Data Science Course at WorldQuant University— where I applied the data wrangling and visualization skills that I learnt,  in examining the real estate market in Mexico(First Project), and also created a machine learning model that predicts apartment prices in Buenos Aires, Argentina(Second Project).  I went on Kaggle  to source for a dataset to this effect. In my search, I stumbled on the CSV file— "nigeria_houses_data.csv" uploaded by Abdullahi Yunus.  https://lnkd.in/djmDdXVX  This dataset contains House listings in Nigeria and their prices based on Location and other parameters.  Datashape (24326, 8)==> 24,326 Observations (rows) and 8 Parameters (columns) .  PARAMETERS:  ~‌Bedrooms -> number of bedrooms in the houses ‌~ Bathrooms -> number of bathrooms in the houses ‌~ Toilets -> number of toilets  ‌~ Parking_space ‌~ Title -> house type ‌~ Town -> town in which the house is located ‌~ State -> state within Nigeria in which the house is located and finally ‌~ Price -> the target column.  Now that our Dataset is ready, be on the look out for  my next post on how I progressed on the project to creating a machine learning model that predicts the price of Detached Duplex in Lagos State, Nigeria .   #datascience #machinelearning #project #realestate #visualization #data #kaggle
